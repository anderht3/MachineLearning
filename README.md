# MachineLearning
Files that start with "CNN", "Accuracy", and "Loss" are the result files. Accuracy and Loss files contain graphs of the accuracy 
losses for the different settings specified in the name (batch size 60, etc.). 
The visualization.py is how the images that were processed through the machine learning code were made. And their source text file
is cent0_st_melting.txt and cent0_default.txt which have the collision information in them. The small_vis zip file includes the 
set of 602 images used for smaller inputs. 
Finally the ipynb file shows the machine learning code with a bit of explanation and only a few results since I cannot run an ipynb
file in ACCRE.
